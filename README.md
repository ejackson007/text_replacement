# text_replacement

## programmable text replacement

Most phones have a built in function now where you can type one thing, and it be autocorrected to another. For example:

- Type: omw
- Replacement: On My Way

This can be really powerful, however i very rarely use it on my phone for things that I type, but there are many cases on my computer where I type the same things, and there is no built in way to do this. There are apps that will do this for you like Typinator that are really powerful, however they all have a paywall to them. Hopefully this will be able to mimic those programs as well as be Open Source.
